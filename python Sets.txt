**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.




Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
